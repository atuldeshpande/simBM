This document gives examples of using the simBM package to generate and plot 1-D and 2-D brownian motion. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(simBM)
```
For example, to generate a one-dimensional brownian motion of length 1000, we use the command

```{r}
a<-simBM(1000,1)
```

On the other hand, if we want to generate a two-dimensional brownian motion of length 500, we use the command

```{r}
b<-simBM(500,2)
```

Lastly, there is an option to 'seed' the brownian motion using a third argument. For example,

```{r}
b<-simBM(500,2,1011)
```

generates 2-D brownian motion after setting the random number generating seed to 1011.
